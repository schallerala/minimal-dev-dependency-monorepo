# @acme/ui

Library of components to share across different applications.


## Build process

The components are mainly build for _production_ with `tsup`.

However, currently, `storybook` support `webpack` or `vite` as build process
to build the React component and produce the stories preview.
As recommended by Storybook and Turbo Repo, `vite` has been selected for local development
and usage of `storybook`.
